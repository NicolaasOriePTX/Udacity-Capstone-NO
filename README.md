**Udacity Capstone Project - Associating Kersoine Prices with Flight Behavior**


**Files**
 
 This repository contains the following folders and files

 data folder
 1) U.S._Kerosene_Wholesale_per_Resale_Price_by_Refiners, containing data on USA kerosine prices
 2) US Airline Flight Routes and Fares 1993-2024, containing data on USA flight behavior

 src folder
 1) main.ipynb, this main file contains the analysis of this repository, leveraging the data from the data folder

 **Purpose of this Repository**

 The purpose of this research to see whether we can find associations between US kerosene prices and US flight behavior. The hypothesis is the high kerosine prices lead to more expensive flights and therefore less flights, passengers and total mileage. The conlusion of the research is that such relationships cannot be found and that flight behavior is not inlfuenced by kersone prices
